# CForth

A simple Forth REPL written in C

### Building

Binaries can be built easily using the GNU Make utility, like so...

`$ make`

The resulting binary can then be found in `./bin/`

Alternatively, if a better debugging experience is desired you could instead run...

`$ make debug`

This will cause the program to be compiled with minimal optimizations and with debug symbols

*Build and tested in Lubuntu 21.04*
